# Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles in Inclement Weather

## Project Overview

This project showcases the application of the YOLOv8 model for object detection, tailored for enhancing the perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles under inclement weather conditions. Our solution focuses on accurately recognizing critical objects such as cars, trucks, and pedestrians, ensuring safety and efficiency in autonomous vehicle navigation despite challenging visibility and sensor performance hurdles posed by adverse weather.
