    ### Model Performance Metrics

    The table below presents the performance metrics of the YOLO model tailored for object detection in inclement weather conditions, crucial for autonomous vehicle navigation. The metrics underscore the model's proficiency in identifying key objects‚Äîcars, trucks, and persons‚Äîwith notable precision and recall rates. 

    | Class   | Images | Instances | Precision | Recall | mAP@0.5 | mAP@0.5:0.95 |
    |---------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|
    | All     | 39     | 290       | 86.2%     | 77.5%   | 84.3%   | 58.9%        |
    | Car     | 39     | 221       | 85.8%     | 76.5%   | 86.1%   | 60.8%        |
    | Person  | 39     | 48        | 78.1%     | 70.8%   | 80.0%   | 45.7%        |
    | Truck   | 39     | 21        | 94.7%     | 85.2%   | 86.9%   | 70.2%        |

    These metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately identifying cars, trucks, and persons, which are essential for the safety and operational efficiency of autonomous vehicles under various weather conditions. However, it's important to note that the model's performance, while impressive, is not infallible. Trained on a relatively small dataset, the model may exhibit limitations in certain complex scenarios typical of inclement weather conditions. Continuous improvements and training on a more diverse and extensive dataset are essential for enhancing the model's robustness and reliability in real-world applications.
